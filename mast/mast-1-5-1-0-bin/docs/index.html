      <b>MAST 1.5.1.0</b>, incuding multipath transactions and a
      corrected analysis of polling schedulers, is now available!
    </a>

    <h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      <b>MAST</b> is an open-source suite of tools to perform
      schedulability analysis of real-time distributed systems that
      assesses a rich variety of timing requirements. Via sensitivity
      analysis, you will know how far or close the system is from
      meeting those requirements. <b>MAST</b> uses a versatile and
      composable input model for the real-time behavior of the modules
      and platforms that form your system.
    </p>

    <p>
      MAST is distributed under a GPL free software license. For
      commercial inquiries related to other licenses please contact
      us.

    </div>

    <h3>A complete set of solutions</h3>

    <p>
      From analysis to design and optimization <b>MAST</b>
      provides a complete set of solutions matching the timing
      characteristics of the most widely used real-time programming
      paradigms. Real-time modeling and timing behavior analysis for
      platforms like Ada, POSIX, or IMA, among many others, are
      accurately supported in a reusable and efficient way.
    </p>

    <h3>Model-based integration</h3>

    <p>
      <b>MAST</b> input and output models are fully described by
      meta-models that enable the integration of tools in a
      model-driven engineering tool chain compliant with the MARTE
      industry standard. Design space exploration is aided by
      monitoring the slacks and launching the tools in a model-based
      engineering environment. From standard UML/MARTE annotated
      models to analysis and back.
    </p>

    <h3>Make the most of your real-time distributed platform</h3>

    <p>
      <b>MAST</b> boosts your distributed platform utilization
      and identifies bottlenecks by performing sensitivity analysis with
      the least pessimistic available techniques. Besides the
      utilizations of the CPUs and networks it reports slacks, which are
      the percentages by which the execution times of all involved
      operations may grow while keeping the system schedulable, or
      should decrease to achieve success.
    </p>

    <h3>A fully design-oriented tool</h3>
    
    <p>
      The tools provided in <b>MAST</b> are fast enough to
      help the designer in the exploration of design alternatives by
      bringing back useful feedback on the capacities of the system to
      keep up with more workload, or on the identification of the
      bottlenecks that tell the designer how much and where to cut in
      order to reach schedulability.
    </p>  

    <h3>Application domains</h3>

    <p>
      <b>MAST</b> has been successfully exploited in
      embedded applications across the most demanding real-time
      systems domains spanning from industrial controllers,
      telecommunications, automotive, avionics and space.
    </p>

    <h3>UML Design environments</h3>

    <p> 
       The MAST model can be used in a UML design environment to
       design real-time applications,&nbsp; representing the real-time
       behavior and requirements together with the design information,
       and allowing an automatic schedulability analysis.  Please
       visit <a href="http://mast.unican.es/umlmast">MAST-UML</a> for
       additional information on this topic.

    <h2><a name="news"></a>News</h2>

    <b>MAST 1.5.1.0</b> is now available. The main elements introduced by this
    version with respect to MAST 1.5.0.1 are:<br>

    <ul>

      <li> 
           Added three new analysis tools: Offset-based approximate
           for global-clock EDF, Offset-based approximate for
           local-clock EDF, Offset-based approximate with precedence
           relations for local-clock EDF.
      </li>

      <li> 
           Added support for the priority assignment tool in multipath
           transactions. 
      </li>

      <li>
	   Corrected the analysis of polling tasks. In previous
	   versions the analysis results were too pessimistic in most
	   cases and optimistic in some other cases.
      </li>

    </ul>

    <b>MAST 1.5.0.1</b> is now available. The main elements introduced by this
    version with respect to MAST 1.5.0.0 are:<br>

    <ul>

      <li> 
           Added support for unlimited strings in pathnames and input
           commands. Previous versions had Strings limited to 512 characters.
      </li>

      <li>
	   Added a new version of the gmast.bat script for Windows, 
           with better support for different Windows versions.
      </li>

    </ul>

    <b>MAST 1.5.0.0</b> is now available. The main elements introduced by this
    version with respect to MAST 1.4.2.0 are:<br>

    <ul>

      <li>
        Added support for multipath trasactions, with join (barrier),
        fork (multicast) and merge (concentrator) event handlers,
        restricted to single input event transactions.
      </li>

      <li>
	New Restrictions:
	<ul>
	  <li>
             Restricted_Multipath_Transactions which implies no branch
             (delivery or query servers) event handlers and only one
             single external event in each transaction.  Multipath
             transactions following this new restriction are only
             supported under the holistic analysis technique, which is
             the most pessimistic for distributed systems. Suport
             under other analysis techniques is left as future work,
             since it requires developing new theory.

    <h2><a name="model"></a>MAST model</h2>

    <p>
      At the heart of the MAST tool suite lies the MAST model, which
      describes the timing behavior of a real-time application. The
      first version of this model (MAST-1) is the one used by the
      schedulability analysis tools. We are currently evolving into
      MAST-2, the second version of our model. In this section we
      describe some important characteristics of both models.
    </p>

    <h3>MAST-1</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
	The model is similar to the one defined in the MARTE UML
        profile for embedded real-time systems.
      </li>

      <li>
	MAST allows modeling both single-processor and complex
	distributed systems.
      </li>

      <li>
	A very complete model of the real time system is used. It is an
        event-driven model which separates the system into several
        views, to ease composition of models and systems:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Platform view, including processors, networks and their
	    schedulers
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Concurrent architecture view, including threads and message
	    streams
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Operations view, including the software modules and
	    messages sent through the networks
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Shared resources view, including mutual exclusion synchronization
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Transactions view, each transaction being an end-to-end
	    flow with workload events, steps involving the execution of
	    operations by threads or message transmissions, events
	    being exchanged among the steps to specify the execution
	    flow, and timing requirements
	  </li>
	</ul>

	<p>
          This separation into different views makes the MAST model
          ideal for analyzing real-time systems that have been
          designed using UML/MARTE or similar design tools.
	</p>

	<p>
	  This independence among the various elements of the model
          eases building a full model through the composition of
          partial models developed independently.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li>
	The system model is independent of the actual analysis
	techniques.
      </li>

      <li>
	Different scheduling techniques are supported, such as fixed
	priorities or dynamic priorities with earliest deadline first
	(EDF) policy. Within the fixed-priority schedulers different
	kinds of policies may be applied:
	<ul>
	  <li>Interrupt service routines</li>
	  <li>Standard fixed priorities</li>
	  <li>Sporadic servers</li>
	  <li>Polling servers</li>
	  <li>Fixed priority packet based policy, for packet-based
	  networks</li>
	  <li>Fixed priority character based policy, for
	  character-oriented networks</li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>
	 Heterogeneous scheduling is supported, with each processor or
	 network using a different scheduling policy.
      </li>

      <li>
	Support for different workload events: singular, periodic,
	sporadic, bursty or unbounded aperiodic.
      </li>

      <li>
	Support for different synchronization protocols: Immediate
	priority ceilings, priority inheritance, stack-based policy.
      </li>

      <li>
	A rich model of the system overheads is provided, including
	context switch times, effects of system timers, or effects of
	communication drivers
      </li>

      <li>
	Schedulers may be composed in a hierarchical way. A tool is
	provided for EDF on top of fixed priorities
      </li>

    </ul>

    <p>
      The MAST model includes the possibility of having <b>multipath
      end-to-end flows</b> where an event flow can be divided into
      several paths with <i>fork</i> (multicast) or branch (delivery or query
      server) elements, and paths may be joined with <i>join</i> (barrier) or
      <i>merge</i> (concentrator) elements. The analysis of these
      multipath transactions uses the holistic analysis technique, and
      is implemented in MAST 1.5 with the following restrictions: the
      transaction has a single input event and only fork, join and
      merge elements are supported; branch is not supported, as the
      current holistic analysis technique is restricted to deadlines
      within the periods for this construct. The holistic analysis
      technique is the most pessimistic, so in the future we plan to
      extend offset-based analysis to handle these multipath
      transactions.
    </p>

    <h3>MAST-2</h3>

    <p>
      The MAST-2 model includes all the elements available in MAST-1
      but changes some of its names to align them with the MARTE UML
      profile for real-time embedded systems. In addition, it includes
      the following new modeling elements:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	Partitioned scheduling with time protection, including the
	possibility of having hierarchical schedulers with fixed
	priority schedulers inside each partition
      </li>

      <li>
	Atomically locking and unlocking the execution thread by a set
	of consecutive steps in an end-to-end flow
      </li>

      <li>
	Network switches
      </li>

      <li>
	Support for AFDX networks and switches
      </li>

      <li>
	Support for contract-based scheduling, with servers providing
	a portion of a resource to a secondary-level scheduler
      </li>

    </ul>

    <p>
      A metamodel of the MAST-2 model can be found 
      <a href="jsimmast/Mast_2_0_Metamodel.pdf">
	here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2> <a name="tools"></a>Available tools </h2>

    <p>
      The MAST toolset includes the following tools:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
 
        Worst-case response time schedulability analysis (RTA) in
	single-processor and distributed systems. This is the main
	tool, and it checks that the worst-case behavior always meets
	the hard real-time requirements. All the offset-based and the
	holistic analysis techniques support distributed systems and
	heterogeneous scheduling, allowing different scheduling
	policies to be used in each processor or network.
      </li>
      
      <ul>

	<li>
	  Offset Based Slanted RTA for fixed priorities
	</li>
	<li>
	  Offset Based Approximate RTA for fixed priorities
	</li>
	<li>
	  Offset-Based Approximate with Precedence Relations RTA for
	  fixed priorities
	</li>
    
	<li>
	  Holistic RTA for fixed priorities, local EDF,
	  and&nbsp;global EDF
	</li>
    
	<li>
	  Classic Rate Monotonic RTA for single processor systems with
	  fixed priorities
	</li>

	<li> 
	  Varying Priorities RTA
	</li>

	<li>
	  EDF Monoprocessor RTA
	</li>
	
	<li>
	  EDF-Within-Priorities RTA, for hierarchical scheduling
	</li>
      </ul>

      <li> 
	Calculation of blocking times
      </li>

      <ul>
	<li> 
	  Single processor
	</li>
    
	<li>
	  Remote blockings for multi-processor
	</li>
    
	<li>
	  Assignment of optimum priority ceilings and preemption levels
	</li>
      </ul>

      <li>

	Sensitivity analysis through the calculation of Slack Times. A
	slack value is the percentage by which the associated element
	(for instance the processor speed, the execution time of an
	operation, or the execution time of an end-to-end flow or of
	the entire system) may be increased while keeping the system
	schedulable, or in case of negative values, the percentage by
	which the associated element has to be reduced to reach
	schedulability. These slack values are very useful in
	providing insight into which parts of the system must be
	modified to reach schedulability, or how much space there is
	for growth or for new steps in the system. The slack
	calculation tools repeat the analysis in a binary search
	algorithm in which execution times are successively increased
	or decreased. The slacks supported are:
      </li>
      <ul>
	<li> Transaction Slacks</li>
	<li> System Slacks</li>
	<li> Processing Resource Slacks</li>
	<li> Operation Slacks</li>
      </ul>

      <li> 
	Optimized Scheduling Parameters Assignment Techniques. This
	tool provides the user with capabilities to automatically
	calculate optimum priorities for fixed priority scheduling,
	and scheduling deadlines for EDF scheduling. The automatic
	assignment uses optimum methods when available, and heuristics
	or optimization techniques when the optimum assignment is not
	available.  The tool also calculates priority ceilings and
	preemption levels for mutual exclusion resources. The
	techniques supported are:
      </li>

      <ul>
	<li> Single-processor</li>
	<li> HOSPA</li>
	<li> Proportional deadline distribution</li>
	<li> Normalized proportional deadline distribution</li>
	<li> Simulated Annealing</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
	A graphical editor generates the system description.
      </li>

      <li>
	A results viewer is available to view the analysis results in
	a convenient way.
      </li>

      <li>
	XML converter. The model and the results are specified through
	an ASCII description that serves as the input and output of
	the analysis tools.  Two ASCII formats have been defined: a
	text special-purpose format and an XML-based format. The XML
	format provides the designer with capabilities to use free
	standard XML tools to validate, parse, analyze, and display
	the model files. The converter tool converts from one format
	to the other or back.
      </li>

      <li>
	Graphical editor for periodic task models. The objective of
	the Periodic Task Editor is to provide an easy way of defining
	a MAST model for a simple task system running on a single
	processor. The editor allows defining periodic tasks with
	their execution times (WCET), periods (T), and Deadlines
	(D). These tasks may interact by sharing mutual exclusion
	resources.
      </li>

      <li>
	Converter from MAST-1 models to MAST-2 format
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      An Event-driven simulation tool is available for MAST-2: 
      <a href="jsimmast/index.html">JSimMAST</a> is able to simulate the
      temporal behavior of real-time systems and is a very interesting
      complement to the worst-case schedulability analysis tools because
      it can provide average-case response times and other performance
      metrics.
    </p>

    <p>
      An older version of the MAST simulator, only for version 1.2.2
      of MAST, is still available from
      the <a href="http://mast.unican.es/simmast/">SIM-MAST</a> page.
